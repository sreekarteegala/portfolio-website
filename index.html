                        <p>
                            As a front-end developer, I started my journey at the company as a fresher and quickly
                            gained expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular. During my time, I had the
                            opportunity to contribute to the successful completion of three diverse projects,
                            enhancing my skills and making a meaningful impact on web development.
                        </p>
                        <!-- <p>Throughout my professional journey, I've had the privilege of working on a diverse range
                            of responsibilities and projects in the field of software development. I've designed and
                            developed interactive user interfaces using a mix of technologies, including AngularJS,
                            HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. These interfaces have not only been
                            visually engaging but also functionally sound, and I've utilized jQuery for client-side
                            validation and UI control display.
                        </p>

                        <p>A significant part of my role has involved the meticulous creation and execution of test
                            cases to ensure the smooth operation of various functionalities. I've actively
                            participated in requirement gathering, contributing to database design and project
                            architecture. In this capacity, I've created tables, stored procedures, and triggers
                            using PL/SQL, demonstrating proficiency in database management.
                        </p>

                        <p>Testing has been a focal point of my work, and I've excelled in identifying possible
                            scenarios and crafting comprehensive test cases for each scenario. Moreover, I've
                            contributed to the development of RESTful Web APIs, providing crucial configuration
                            management data. This included the development of RESTful web APIs with Node.js and web3
                            interaction, as well as APIs for both private and public blockchains, enabling secure
                            transactions and user voting processes.
                        </p>

                        <p>In addition to technical contributions, I've undertaken professional functions in
                            software programming and analysis. This has involved assisting in the entire software
                            development lifecycle, from design and coding to testing, deployment, maintenance,
                            enhancement, and support of company software systems. I've not only developed new
                            software but also customized solutions to align with specific company needs.
                        </p>

                        <p>Furthermore, I've been actively involved in integrating software interfaces with
                            third-party business systems and designing and implementing solutions that seamlessly
                            integrate products with third-party applications or products. My experience extends to
                            collaborative work within medium-sized teams, employing agile development processes, and
                            thriving in cross-functional team environments.

                        <p>Bringing three years of prior experience to my role as a backend developer at the company, I
                            further expanded my skill set by mastering Git, Bitbucket, and CI/CD pipelines, enabling
                            efficient code automation and seamless integration in our development processes.</p>

                            development lifecycle, from coding and compiling to unit testing, integration, packaging,
                            and deployment of the developed software. This end-to-end approach has allowed me to ensure
                            that the software is not only well-written but also thoroughly tested and seamlessly
                            integrated into the existing ecosystem.
                        </p>

                        <p>A significant part of my role has involved creating and executing unit tests and conducting
                            basic application testing. This practice has been essential in identifying and rectifying
                            any issues early in the development process, contributing to the overall reliability of the
                            software.
                        </p>

                        <p>To support these efforts, I have gained proficiency in using various essential tools and
                            platforms such as Jira, GitHub, GitLab, Bit Bucket, and Boost AI. These tools have played a
                            pivotal role in project management, version control, and collaboration among team members.
                        </p>

                        <p>One notable achievement in my role has been the integration of Hygieia - DevOps Dashboard.
                            Hygieia has allowed for the aggregation of an end-to-end view of the delivery pipeline,
                            enhancing visibility and control over the software delivery process.
                        </p>

                        <p>Additionally, I have leveraged Bit Bucket to create a pipeline that automates the process of
                            pushing code to GitHub, running tests, and deploying the software to UAT and Prod
                            environments. This automation has not only expedited the deployment process but also
                            improved its accuracy and reliability.
                        </p>

                        <p>Through these responsibilities and achievements, I have contributed to the development of
                            robust and well-tested software solutions while embracing modern DevOps practices and tools.
